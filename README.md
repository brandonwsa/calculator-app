# Calculator App

## About this App:
- This app is a simple calculator app that takes in 2/3 input fields, miles, speed (in mph), and/or time (in hours), and calculates the blank input field based on the other 2.

## How to Use the App
- If user wants to calculate how fast they will have to travel in order to cover the provided miles in the specified time they want, simply input the miles you want to travel in the miles input field and how long you want to travel for in the time input field and the speed in which you have to travel to accomplish this will be calculated.
- In order to use the app, you will currently need Android Studio, so you can use the Android emulator, and you will have to import the project and run it from the IDE until it is released in the Play Store.
